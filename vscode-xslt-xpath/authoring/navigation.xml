			<p>Visual Studio Code includes a compelling set of features for code navigation, 
				the language-neutral details are outlined here <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved">here</a>.</p>
			<p>This page outlines code navigation from an XSLT and XPath development perspective.</p>
			<h3>File Navigation</h3>
			<p>
				While the Explorer View is used for workspace browsing, pressing <span class="shortcut">⌘P</span>, for the <strong>Quick Open</strong>
				command, provides a quick-pick list of available files that is filtered/highlighted as you type.
			</p>
			<p>File tabs are arranged in one or more Editor Groups. Editor Groups are arranged either adjacent or above/below other Editor groups.
			The same file may be open in more than one Editor Group. There are settings to control whether file tabs are scrollable or wrapped
				within an Editor Group.</p>
			<p>Hold <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> and press <span class="shortcut">Tab</span> for a list of files in an Editor Group. Keep pressing
			<span class="shortcut">Tab</span> until you reach the file you want and then release <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> to open it.</p>
			<h5>Previous/Next Location</h5>
			<p>Many actions can be used to navigate you to a new location. Press <span class="shortcut">⌃-</span> for <strong>Previous Location</strong> and <span class="shortcut">⌃⇧-</span> for
			<strong>Next Location</strong>. Locations may be in the same file or different files.</p>
			<h3>XSLT/XML BreadCrumbs</h3>
			<p>
				The BreadCrumb View, shown at the top of the editor, shows the current element or attribute location
				within an XML or XSLT file with respect to ancestor elements. In XSLT Breadcrumbs, an identifier is often shown as well as the element name.
				This may be for example the <code>name</code> of an <code>xsl:variable</code> or the <code>mode</code> of an <code>xsl:template</code>.
				The symbol names are the same as those shown in the Outline view.
			</p>
			<aside>Note: You can toggle the BreadCrumbs view on/off but if the BreadCrumbs view is disabled this will also disable XML, XSLT or XPath Warnings and Errors
				as the Code Checker depends on the symbol name structure.</aside>
