			<p>Visual Studio Code includes a compelling set of features for code navigation, 
				the language-neutral details are outlined <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved">here</a>.</p>
			<p>This page outlines code navigation from an XSLT and XPath development perspective.</p>
			<h3>File Navigation</h3>
			<p>
				While the Explorer View is used for workspace browsing, pressing <span class="shortcut">⌘P</span>, for the <strong>Quick Open</strong>
				command, provides a quick-pick list of available files that is filtered/highlighted as you type.
			</p>
			<p>File tabs are arranged in one or more Editor Groups. Editor Groups are arranged either adjacent or above/below other Editor groups.
			The same file may be open in more than one Editor Group. There are settings to control whether file tabs are scrollable or wrapped
				within an Editor Group.</p>
			<p>Hold <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> and press <span class="shortcut">Tab</span> for a list of files in an Editor Group. Keep pressing
			<span class="shortcut">Tab</span> until you reach the file you want and then release <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> to open it.</p>
			<h5>Previous/Next Location</h5>
			<p>Many actions can be used to navigate you to a new location. Press <span class="shortcut">⌃-</span> for <strong>Previous Location</strong> and <span class="shortcut">⌃⇧-</span> for
			<strong>Next Location</strong>. Locations may be in the same file or different files.</p>
			<h5>File Links</h5>
			<p>In XSLT, The <code>href</code> attribute values of <code>xsl:import</code>, <code>xsl:include</code> and <code>xsl:use-package</code> have a solid underline if the file path is resolved.
			Press <span class="shortcut">⌘+Click</span> on the file path to navigate to that file.</p>
			<h3>XSLT/XML Breadcrumbs</h3>
			<p>
				The Breadcrumb View, shown at the top of the editor, shows the current element or attribute location
				within an XML or XSLT file with respect to ancestor elements. In XSLT Breadcrumbs, an identifier is often shown as well as the element name.
				This may be for example the <code>name</code> of an <code>xsl:variable</code> or the <code>mode</code> of an <code>xsl:template</code>.
				The symbol names are the same as those shown in the Outline view.
			</p>
			<p>Clicking on a Breadcrumb item will show a dropdown Outline view which you can then navigate through with the mouse, touch or cursor keys.</p>
			<h5>Keyboard Navigation</h5>
			<p>
				Press <span class="shortcut">⇧⌘.</span> (note the 'dot' character) to select the last Breadcrumb item and open <strong>with</strong> a dropdown outline. 
				You can then use cursor keys
				to navigate the dropdown outline. Alternatively, press <span class="shortcut">⇧⌘;</span> (note the 'semi-colon' character) 
				to select the last Breadcrumb item <strong>without</strong> a dropdown outline. 
				Use the <span class="shortcut">←</span> and <span class="shortcut">→</span> keys to select a Breadcrumb item or the
				<span class="shortcut">↓</span> for the dropdown outline.
			</p>
			<aside>Note: You can toggle the Breadcrumbs view on/off but if the Breadcrumbs view is disabled this will also disable XML, XSLT or XPath Warnings and Errors.
				The Code Checker depends on the symbol name provider that Breadcrumbs invokes.</aside>
			<h3>Outline View</h3>
			<img src="resources/navigation.png" class="scale-with-grid" />
			
			<p>
				The <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_outline-view">Outline View</a> (see right-hand panel) is a panel
				that, by default, is positioned below
				the File Explorer in the Primary Side Bar. This can be moved however into other panels such as the Secondary Side Bar (see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/sidebars">Sidebars</a>).
				The Outline view renders the XML or XSLT document element hierarchy as a tree, symbol names in the tree include element identifiers such
				as the <code>mode</code> for an <code>xsl:template</code>.
			</p>
			<p>Symbols in the Outline View can be sorted by position, name or category. There's also a '<strong>Filter on Type</strong>' mode that
			filters the Outline View while you type in part of a symbol name.</p>
			
			<aside>Note: XML Attributes are shown in the outline view by default, they are grouped inside an element 
				within an attributes 'array' symbol. If you find attributes clutter the XML element outline you can hide 
				them in <a href="settings.html">Settings</a> with the property: <code>outline.showArrays</code>. 				
			</aside>

			<h3>Peek/Goto Definition</h3>
			<p>A symbol, such as a variable or function, is defined in one location in a stylesheet file, but used in other locations.
			The <strong>Peek</strong> and <strong>Goto</strong>	commands let you either view inline or navigate to the definition of a selected symbol.
			</p>
			<h5>Peek Definition</h5>
			
			<p>Invoke the <strong>Peek Definition</strong> command by pressing (<span class="shortcut">⌥F12</span>) on any symbol name such as a variable or function name.
				This command embeds a view of the definition inline avoiding the context-switch arising from the <strong>Goto Definition</strong> command.
				The inline definition view permits quick edits of the definition also. Press <span class="shortcut">Escape</span> to close the definition view.
			</p>
			<img src="resources/peek-definition.png" class="scale-with-grid" />
			<h5>Goto Definition</h5>
			<p>
				Invoke the <strong>Goto Definition</strong> command by pressing (<span class="shortcut">F12</span>) on any symbol name such as a variable or function name.
				This command navigates you to the location of the symbol definition (for example, the corresponding <code>xsl:variable</code> instruction),
				opening the containing stylesheet file in the editor group if not already open.
			</p>
			
			<!-- start -->			
			<h3>Goto (Peek) References/Find All References</h3>
			<p>This feature is about navigating to <strong>references</strong> to symbols, in contrast to the previous section that covers navigating to symbol <strong>definitions</strong>.
				The <strong>Peek</strong> and <strong>Find All</strong>	commands let you either view inline or navigate through all the references (including the definition) of a selected symbol.
			</p>
			<h5>Goto (Peek) References</h5>
			
			<p>Invoke the <strong>Goto (Peek) References</strong> command by pressing (<span class="shortcut">⇧F12</span>) on any symbol name such as a variable or function name.
				This command embeds a view of the resolved references inline, use the cursor keys to navigate between each reference listed.
				The inline view permits quick edits of the reference also. Press <span class="shortcut">Escape</span> to close the references view.
			</p>
			<img src="resources/peek-reference.png" class="scale-with-grid" />
			<h5>Find All References</h5>
			<p>
				Invoke the <strong>Find All References</strong> command by pressing (<span class="shortcut">⌥⇧F12</span>) on any symbol.
				A References Panel, shown in the application Side Bar, lists all references, grouped by their stylesheet module.
				Use the cursor keys to move through the references and press <span class="shortcut">Enter</span> to open the editor in
				the reference location.
			</p>
			<p>After navigating to a reference or definition, you can quickly navigate to the location you were in using <span class="shortcut">Ctrl-</span></p>
			<!-- end -->
			
			<h3>Goto Symbol</h3>
			<p>Use the <strong>Goto Symbol in Editor</strong> command <span class="shortcut">Shift⌘O</span> for a filtered quick-pick list of symbols used
			in the current editor.
				The text you enter filters the list, the <span class="shortcut">↑</span> and <span class="shortcut">↓</span> keys navigate you through the symbol list, with the
				current symbol item highlighted in the editor. Press <span class="shortcut">Enter</span> to navigate to the symbol in the current editor
				or <span class="shortcut">⌘Enter</span> to open an adjacent editor and navigate to the symbol there.
