			<p>With <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deltaxml.xslt-xpath">DeltaXML's XSLT/XPath extension</a>
				, Visual Studio Code is now a fully featured
			XSLT 3.0 editor, standalone XPath 3.1 files are also fully supported. Visual Studio's rich ecosystem is now available to XSLT and XPath developers.</p>
			
			<p>This documentation here focuses on XSLT and XPath language features. More general XML features are
				covered on the <a href="editing.html">Editing XML</a> page.
				Fuller but language-neutral descriptions of the features covered here can be found in Microsoft's 
				<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics"> Visual Studio Code User Guide.</a></p>
			<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>
			<p>For improved performance and precision, this extension avoids the default 
				but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77140">problematic TM Grammar</a>
				and instead exculisvely uses Visual Studio Code's releatively new 
				<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide">Semantic Highlighting</a> 
				feature. For external color themes you therefore need to explicitly enable Semantic Highlighting. See
				the <a href="settings.html">Settings</a> page for more information.
			</p>
			<p>There is syntax highlighting for XSLT instructions, Literal Result Elements, XML attributes, XML character references, CDATA sections 
				and all tokens within XPath expressions. XPath expressions within Attribute Value Templates (AVTs) and 
				Text Value Templates are syntax highlighted also.</p>
