      <p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview">GitHub Copilot</a> for Visual Studio Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that provides real-time code suggestions and completions
       to enhance developer productivity.
      </p>
      <p>Extensions like the XSLT/XPath extension for Visual Studio Code are leveraged by GitHub copilot to enhance the coding experience
        by providing more detailed information on syntax issues and enabling syntax highlighting. When developers use the XSLT/XPath
        extension, Copilot can analyze the code and offer suggestions or corrections for syntax errors, making it easier to identify
        and resolve problems. This integration allows Copilot to understand the specific syntax rules and patterns of XSLT/XPath,
        providing more accurate and context-aware assistance.</p>

      <h4>Fixing XSLT Errors</h4>
      <h5>Within the Editor</h5>
      <p>A GitHub <strong>Copilot star icon</strong> appears in the margin on the same line of an error selected in the XSLT editor. When the icon
        is clicked a popup panel will explain the problem and a suggested solution. Click the <code>Accept</code> icon if
        you want to accept the solution, the edit will them be made for you.
      </p>

      <h5>Copilot Chat Panel</h5>
      <p>An alternative approach, from within the <strong>Copilot Chat</strong> panel, is to enter the prompt: <code>@workspace /fix</code>.
        This will explain the problem with the selected error and suggest a solution.
