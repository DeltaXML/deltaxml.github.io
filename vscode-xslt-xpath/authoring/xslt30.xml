				<strong>XSLT 3.0</strong>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-xslt-30-20170608/">published by W3c on 8 June 2017</a>,
				is the latest stable version of XSLT. As such, it is the target version for  
				XSLT in this extension, alongside <strong>XPath 3.1</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>Learning XSLT 3.0</h3>
			<p>The online W3C documentation for XSLT 3.0, along with its XPath 3.1 sub-language, comprises 3 main parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-xslt-30-20170608/">XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 3.0</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/">XML Path Language (XPath) 3.1</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/">XPath and XQuery Functions and Operators 3.1</a></li>
			</ul>
			<aside>Note: The <a hrer="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization-31/W3C">XSLT 3.1 Serialization</a> specification 
				is published separately as this is shared with XQuery.</aside>
			<p>While the size of each part of the XSLT specifications may appear daunting at first, each part is well-structured, with a Table of Contents
			panel that makes it easy to navigate. Many code samples are included with the specification.	
			</p>
			<h4>Offline Reading Material</h4>
			<p>There are no published books for XSLT 3.0, but the <a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780470192740">XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 Programmer's Reference</a>
				by Michael Kay
				is frequently recommended. XSLT 3.0 is a signicant enhancement to XSLT 2.0 but it builds on the fundamental principals and language in XSLT 2.0.
			</p>
			<h4>Video Tutorials</h4>
			<p>A set of video tutorials by Dimitre Novatchev is available:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/xslt-foundations-part1">XSLT 2.0 and 1.0 Foundations</a>.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/xpath-3-0-whats-new">The Evolution of XPath: Whatâ€™s New in XPath 3.0</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Supporting XSLT Processors</h3>
			<p>This extension integrates with the Saxon XSLT processor by Saxonica via XSLT tasks through the Saxon command-line interface. 
				Saxon is probably the most popular/ubiquitous XSLT 3.0 procesor. 
				It publishes specification <a href="https://www.saxonica.com/documentation11/#!conformance/xslt30">conformance data</a> 
				and supports <a href="https://www.saxonica.com/products/platforms.xml">many platforms</a>.
				A free open source version <a href="https://github.com/Saxonica/Saxon-HE">Saxon-HE</a> is available along with 
				paid-for 'Professional' and 'Enterprise' variants are also available. These are
				summarised in a <a href="https://www.saxonica.com/products/feature-matrix-12.xml">feature matrix</a>.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Altova's <a href="https://www.altova.com/raptorxml">RaptorXML</a> server supports XSLT 3.0 - no integration with
				Visual Studio Code is available as ALtova offer their own paid-for 
				<a href="https://www.altova.com/xmlspy-xml-editor/xslt-editor">XML/XSLT development solution</a>. No XSLT standards conformance
				data is published for this processor.
