			Overview
			
				
					Coding in modern XSLT presents a rewarding yet challenging experience for the developer.
					Discover in this guide how Visual Studio Code, extended with DeltaXML's 
					XSLT/XPath extension, 
					can help with editing, reviewing, refactoring and running XSLT.
				
				
					XSLT 3.0 support is standard. The proposed XSLT 4.0 support is invoked by setting version="4.0" on the root element.
				
				
                     These pages complement the extensive Visual Studio Code documentation that begins:
				
				
					Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is
					available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a
					rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages...
				
				
					
				
				The User Interface
				
					Visual Studio Code's user interface
					has a different look and feel to that of legacy XSLT editors. The Command Palette, along with keybindings to
					most common commands, play a signficant role in provding a clearer environment to work in. User interface clutter is significantly
					reduced by eschewing previous designs which depended on a set of toolbars, each with an abundance of buttons.

				The application menu bar and associated dropdown menus usefully group the more essential actions for managing your code.
				The View menu is particularly useful as it logically sets out the large set of view-configuration commands.
				
			  The sections below introduce you to the fundamental parts of the user interface from the perspective of an XSLT/XPath developer.
				
				The Command Palette
				A principal part of Visual Studio Code's user interface is the Command
					Palette,
					triggered
					by the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘P.
					The Command Palette shows all available commands in a dropdown
					list. The list of commands is
					filtered as you type. The most recently used commands are shown at the top of the list.
				
				Keyboard Shortcuts
				
					While the Command Palette provides convenient access to features you should find that keyboard shortcuts are
					more effective for commands you use most
					frequently.
					The keyboard shortcut for commands is shown alongside each listed command in the Command Palette. Not all
					commands
					have key bindings, but these can be configured using the command
					Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts
					(⌘K⌘S). See: 
						Key Bindings for Visual Studio Code
				
				Settings
				By adding or modifying Visual Studio Settings, using the Preferences: Open User Settings
					command,
					you can customize a range of editor and extension features to meet your needs.
					See the Settings section for details on some of the more important settings for
					developing in XSLT and XPath.
				
				Install the XSLT/XPath Extension
				Extensions are managed in the Extensions view (⇧⌘X) of the Side Bar.
					Type XSLT XPath in the Extensions view search bar and, on the XSLT/Path for Visual Studio
						Code entry, press the install button
					.
				
					
				
				Color Theme Extensions
				Visual Studio Code includes a small set of light and dark color themes. Alternative color themes are
					installed as extensions. The number of available themes can be overwhelming,
					but VS Code has a built-in Theme Preview feature and there are websites like vscodethemes that provide
					a preview before installing the theme.
				
				The XSLT Dark Themes extension provides
				a set of popular dark color themes specially enhanced for XSLT and XPath
				The XSLT/XPath extension syntax highlighter uses 
						Semantic Highlighting that should be enabled specifically in Settings to work with external color
					themes.
					Highlighter tokens are defined to provide effective highlighting for all the common color themes.
				
				Other Extensions
				Among the hundreds of high quality extensions available for Visual Studio Code,
					Live Share,
					for collaborative working
					and Live Server
					for when you're generating HTML with XSLT are particularly useful.
				
				Edit XML, XSLT or XPath
				
					For a comprehensive guide to the Visual Studio Code editor features see the Microsoft Visual Studio Code
					User Guide.
				
				Language Specific Features
				XSLT and XPath specific editing features are described in the Editing
						XSLT/XPath page
					of the documentation that your are reading now. More general XML editing features are described in the Editing XML section.
				The features described at Editing XSLT/XPath include:
				
				
					IntelliSense (Auto Complete)
					Syntax Highlighting
					Code Formatting
					Code Refactoring
					Symbol Renaming
					Code Refactoring
					XSLT/XPath Linter
				
				

				Run XSLT - Quick Start
				XSLT transforms are run using Visual Studio Code Tasks.
					Before configuring an XSLT task you should ensure that you open a
					Workspace folder (⌘O) from Visual Studio Code.
					The configuration is saved in a tasks.json file in this workspace folder.
				
				To create your first task, use the Run Build Task command (⇧⌘B).
					As there is no currently configured task, you should be prompted to configure one 
					(if another extension inhibits this, run Configure Task instead). You can then,
					select either the Saxon or Saxon-JS task.
				A task will be added to the tasks.json task with default properties. To further configure the
					task, these properties can be changed or other properties added. Auto-completion and hints are provided to
					assist in the task configuration. Next time you press ⇧⌘B your task will be run
					in a Task tab in the Terminal window (toggled with ⌘J).
				
        More on running XSLT
				XSLT Tasks are explained in full in the Running XSLT section. More general
					information can be found in the Visual Studio Code Tasks
					documentation.
